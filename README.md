Hi! This is a C++ implementation of the popular board game Battleship.
To best emulate the game you should have two "players" but the nature of
the program will show both player's boards each move anyways. 
The display will be through the command-line terminal, so the focus
of this project is clearly not the visual aspects, but the building
of multiple files, classes, and child classes to create one project.
