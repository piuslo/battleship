Hi! This is a C++ implementation of the popular board game Battleship.
To best emulate the game you should have two "players" (although both
players will end up knowing the other's boards because I couldn't figure
out how to work the project so that hitting one square of a ship would "sink
the whole ship". The display will be through the command-line terminal, 
so the focus of this project is clearly not the visual aspects, but the 
building of multiple files, classes, and child classes to create one project.
